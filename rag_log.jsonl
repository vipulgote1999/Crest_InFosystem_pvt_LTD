Let me start by looking at the two entries given. Both passengers have PassengerId 762 and 322, and they both survived 0, meaning they didn't survive the Titanic. Their Pclass is 3, which is third class, so they were in the lower decks. \n\nThe names are Nirva, Mr. Iisakki Antino Aijo and Danoff, Mr. Yoto. Both are male, and their ages are 41 and 27 respectively. SibSp and Parch are both 0, so they don't have siblings, spouses, or parents aboard. Their tickets are SOTON/O2 3101272 and 349219, and the fares are 7.125 and 7.8958. They were both embarked from S.\n\nI need to explain this data in detail. So the data includes information like passenger ID, survival status, class, names, gender, age, family details, ticket numbers, fares, and embarkation port. Then, for the bullet points, I should summarize the key points: both passengers were in third class, male, no family members on board, similar fares, and both died. Also, they were embarked from S. I should check if there's any other info, like the cabin being empty, but that's not specified for either. Make sure the bullet points are concise and highlight the main points.\n</think>\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**  \nThe data includes information about two passengers from the Titanic dataset.
